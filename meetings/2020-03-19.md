## Agenda

* Review Governance [#1](https://github.com/nodejs/web-server-frameworks/issues/1)
  * Ethan: are we ready to close. PR opened and landed to adjust. Believe we should
    be ready
  * Have agreed on 2 different times to make it easier for people from different timezones 
    to attend.
  * Will close issue.

* docs: join instructions in README.md [#4] (https://github.com/nodejs/web-server-frameworks/pull/4)
  * a requested change, but should be able to update today
  * will accept all open join requests today as well
  * Gireesh, + others we should continue to be open about letting people join easily.

* 'stream' vs 'request' API [#19](https://github.com/nodejs/web-server-frameworks/issues/19)
  * Tomas added http2 support for Fastify using the compat api - did not use stream
  * Wes moved request/response out of the main Express repo to better support HTTP2/3; very
    soon wants to start more robust support 
  * Why aren’t we seeing http2 apps? 
  * Netflix is using it over GRPC
  * Many are terminating at a NGINX layer
  * Nginx didn’t support a reverse http2 unless in a paid platform so many devs couldn’t do
    application layer things like push thus treating apps like http1 
  * Great example of GraphQL and HTTP3 would be really beneficial for folks
  * What are the real benefits of http2?
  * Check out auto-push packages:
    https://github.com/google/node-h2-auto-push
    https://github.com/google/node-fastify-auto-push
    https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/node-js-can-http-2-push-b491894e1bb1
  * Communicate more on ‘how is http2 being used in the wild’
  * Is HTTP3 going to have a compat layer? We should ask James 
  * Action items: Reach out to folks at Cloudflare and Google. Reach out to James. What does HTTP3 look like for the framework layer; do we need to develop a compat layer? 
  * When do we stop supporting compat layers?

* Improved set header and set cookie
   experience[#32](https://github.com/nodejs/web-server-frameworks/issues/32) 
  *  One of the things problematic in today’s Express cookie module is if you call setHeader it overrides the previous header value 
  * Could this live in Node core?
  * Rather than be specific on cookies, can we expand the header utilities in node core?
  * Some breakaways: appendHeader issue, setCookieHeader discussion, cookie or header parsing
  * is it too much to bring all header stuff into core? Is it better to focus on just cookies?
  * jshttp has a lot of work on this already
  * members apart of this group should start maintaining http in core
  * members apart of this group can step up to help squash security issues in http related modules in core too
  * We should put the callout that we are looking for contributors in this area
  * each of the frameworks should look for volunteers to contribute to node.js security 

* Discuss modules in CITGM [#35](https://github.com/nodejs/web-server-frameworks/issues/35)
  * Ethan, recently saw on twitter library that would run unit tests for each of your npm
    dependencies. Anybody remember the name?  This one reads package.json and
    clone and runes all of the unit tests.
  * Wes, today you can submit PR for modules
